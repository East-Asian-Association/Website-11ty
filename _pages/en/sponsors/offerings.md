### Lunch seminar

Our lunch seminars are our most popular form of collaboration, where you have the opportunity to speak to the students at Link√∂ping University during the lunch break (45 min). Usually there are around 75 to 150 listeners.

### Social media or Website marketing

We have both Instagram and Facebook where we have a combined group of more than 1600 followers.

### Case events

We offer the opportunity for you to arrange a case-event, focusing on different job markets with a few selected students.
