### Diversity

EAA is a student association and a student section, and we are more than 200 members active in EAA each year.

Our association are made up of Swedish students who are studying everything from Industrial Engineering and Management International to Computer Science, exchange students and alumni's working in a diversity of sectors.

We all have one thing in common, our interest for East Asia.

### Competence

A majority of our members are fluent or semi-fluent in languages (apart from Swedish and English) such as Japanese, Chinese and Korean.

Many of these combines their education with a specific East Asian language, making them sought after by many employees.
