### Dear student,

We at the East Asian Association would like to welcome you to Linköping University, LiU, and especially to your year in Asia Studies. Whether you have chosen Chinese or Japanese, we hope that you will have a rewarding study period.

In order to offer the best possible reception for the new students, we have a welcoming group called TEKKEN, whose job is to plan a variety of fun events in order to introduce you to student life in Linköping. You should therefore turn to TEKKEN if you have any questions regarding the reception itself.

The ambition of the [reception guide]({{ "/en/asia-studies/welcome-period" | htmlBaseUrl}}) on this site is to facilitate the transition process and answer some of the questions new students have. We have therefore tried to gather the information we think is most relevant, such as schedules, tips for looking for accommodation, contact persons, useful links and more. If any information is missing, please do not hesitate to contact us.

We hope you will enjoy your stay with us and we from the East Asian Section look forward to seeing you in August!

With kind regards,  
The board of the East Asian Association
