### What is a "sittning"?

"Sittning" is a kind of dining event and is very common at universities in Sweden. Literally translated to English as "sitting" it usually contains food, preformances and singing. 

### EAA Sittning

We usually arrange two big dining events every year for our members with 2 different themes, as is customary for a "Sittning". 

Our dining events are especially popular among our exchange student members since it allows them to experience traditional Swedish student life!
