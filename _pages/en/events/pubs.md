### EAA Pubs

We arrange student pubs where our members can get **very cheap food** together with good drinks. 
Usually we serve East Asian or Swedish dishes. This is also a big part of the Swedish student life 
and our pubs are located in “Gasquen”, in the bottom floor of the Kårallen-building at Campus Valla. 
***Disclaimer:*** *Karaoke may appear during our pubs.*
