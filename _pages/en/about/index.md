### What is the EAA?

The East Asian Association, or EAA for short, is a student association at Linköping University founded the 28th of April 2009 as a collaboration by and for students interested in East Asia.

Today the association has around **200 members** from all over the world, but primarily Sweden, Japan, China and Korea.

We host a lot of events every year where some are typical Swedish student life events and others are more focused on language and cultural exchange. We encourage everyone to join in these events and have as much fun as possible! If you are interested you can find more information under [Events](/events).

### Our Mission

One of the main responsibilities for EAA is to help new exchange students feel a part of the Swedish student life, as well as help them get intouch with swedish students.

The other main role for EAA is to host welcoming activities for new Swedish students coming to Linköping University to study Mandarin or Japanese combined with Engineering.
